title: "Incremental Stock Volume Prediction with Gradient Distillation and Diversified Memory Selection"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/incremental_stock_volume_prediction
excerpt: 'Stock volume forecasting is a typical time series regression task, which aims to predict the trading volume according to historical transaction data. In this paper, we explore an incremental learning scenario of volume prediction, which is a more practical setting as new data comes in over time. Traditional incremental framework based on memory prediction consistency is primarily targeted at classification tasks and neglects the characteristics of regression problems, resulting in poor knowledge transfer efficiency of the memorized samples in incremental volume prediction. To remedy this problem, we incorporate a gradient distillation term during the model update stage to fully exploit the information contained in the memory. We also propose a di
versified memory construction method during the memory update stage to further improve memory utilization. Experiments on real-world stock data and further analyses demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method to existing incremental learning approaches.'
